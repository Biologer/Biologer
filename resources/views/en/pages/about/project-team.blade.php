                The original Project team was made of a few enthusiasts that decided
                to run the project Biologer. Project team has the highest authority
                in the Biologer community. Project team directly decides about further
                development of Biologer platform. In order to involve new people in
                Project team or make changes to the current team, an agreement of
                the 2/3 of the Project team members must be made. When starting a new
                local community, the members of the Project team must name at least
                two Administrators of the local Biologer platform. The members of the
                project team are at the same time the representatives of the Organisations
                that support the work of the platform:
