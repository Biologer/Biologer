                Good scientific practice must ensure that the all records from the field
                can be verifiable, thus for each observation Biologer shows who

                and when (date) certain taxa has bean recorded. To ensure verifiability,
                users are required to correctly enter personal information, while providing
                false information can lead to deletion of the user account. If you
                would like to restrict access of your personal data for people outside
                of the editorial board (administrators and taxonomic experts for a
